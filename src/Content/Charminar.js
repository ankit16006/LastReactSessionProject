        <span > Dubbed the Arc de Triomphe of the east and Hyderabad’s most iconic structure, Charminar, 
        was built to mark the eradication of the epidemic cholera that had ravaged the city in the 16th century. 
        Lying on the east bank of the Musi river with the Laad Bazaar to its west and Makkah Masjid to the south-west, 
        Charminar is a cultural and historical landmark that translates into four minars or pillars in Urdu. The area 
        around the monument is also referred to as Charminar, and for a first-timer a tour of the Nizam 
        city is incomplete without taking in the infectious energy of the place where it all began. 
        Albeit traffic-ridden, the bazaars are still chaotic with their labyrinthine by-lanes heaving with hawkers, 
        bangle sellers and food stalls.</span><br></br><br></br><hr></hr>

        <span >The Charminar was built in 1591 after Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth king of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, moved his 
capital from Golconda, due to shortage of water, to Hyderabad city. Listed under the Archaeological Survey of India, 
theories abound on the reason for the construction of the Charminar. However, the two most probable ones 
historians rely on include the moving of capitals from Golconda to Hyderabad under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah who 
prayed for the end of Cholera that had caused many deaths in his city, and had taken an oath to build a mosque on 
the site in which he prayed. Marking the end of the plague, Charminar stands on the very site. Persian texts, on the 
other hand, refer to a narration by a French traveller from the 17th century to the commemoration of the beginning of 
Islam’s second millennium year 1000 AH as the reason for the construction of the Charminar in 1591.</span><br></br>
<br></br><hr></hr>

<span >It is no surprise that the old city of Hyderabad came up around the Charminar, and its strategic positioning at 
the intersection of historical trade routes that connects the port city of Machilipatnam with the markets of Golconda.</span><br></br>
<br></br><hr></hr>

<span >Built in Indo-Islamic architectural style, Charminar is a limestone, granite, pulverised marble and mortar structure with 
four embellished minarets attached to the four arches. Only a year after the city of Hyderabad was founded in 1591, 
the construction of the Charminar was concluded. This 14,000 tonne building meant to serve as a madarsa and mosque 
was built in a way that on opening the fort doors, the minarets would loom out and throw open the entire expanse of 
the bustling Hyderabad city around it. A square base with 20-metre-long sides and four arches that open into the four 
streets with each minaret on the corner, Charminar stands out for these ornate 184-foot minarets that are rich in 
detailing and come with a double balcony. On top of each minaret is a bulbous dome, but Charminar’s minarets unlike 
the Taj Mahal’s are attached to the superstructure.</span><br></br><br></br><hr></hr>

<span >Not just Charminar’s strategic positioning or its significance in the history of Hyderabad, the structure still 
holds visitors in awe for its elaborate stucco work, and the fluidity in the placement of the balconies and balustrades. 
Legend has it that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah built an underground tunnel connecting Charminar to Golconda Fort as 
an escape route in case of a siege. Though the location of the tunnel has not been ascertained till date.</span><br></br><br></br><hr></hr>


<span >In Qutb Shah’s reign, the western end of the open roof was a mosque while the remainder of the space served as a court. 
To get to the upper floor, there is a fleet of 149 steps. But it is the top floor of the four-storey building that 
houses the mosque. Charminar has two galleries one on top of the other, and over them is the terrace that comes with a 
stone balcony. The open space in the main gallery is meant for the Friday prayers.</span><br></br><br></br><hr></hr>

Over the years, several changes were made to the structure, the most significant one being the addition of the 
giant clock in 1889.
